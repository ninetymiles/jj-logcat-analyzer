## Background

When debugging android media app, the codec/reader/processor pipeline may very long and print massive log, very hard to analyze the pipeline by reading the log file directly.

So we need a log analyzer to parse logcat and make the data/events visible.

JJ stand for Ji-Ji-Ru-Lv-Ling (急急如律令), a Taoism magical spell, just like 'abracadabra'.

## Usage

TBD.
